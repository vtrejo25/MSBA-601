    "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following hard-coded rules, a machine learning model uses algorithms to analyze patterns in data and make decisions or predictions based on that data."
