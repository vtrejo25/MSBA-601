    "# Comparison of Classification Algorithms on the Iris Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook compares the performance of different classification algorithms on the Iris dataset. The algorithms compared are:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Decision Tree\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "- Naive Bayes\n",
    "- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the accuracy of each model and visualize the decision tree for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome based on input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Linear Combination**: Combines input features with weights.\n",
    "- **Sigmoid Function**: Converts the linear combination into a probability.\n",
    "- **Thresholding**: Classifies based on the probability (e.g., >0.5 for Setosa).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Works well for binary classification.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Outputs probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Linear Boundaries**: Assumes a linear relationship between features and the outcome, which might not capture complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "Decision Tree is a non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Splitting**: Starts at the root and splits the data based on feature values to create branches.\n",
    "- **Decision Nodes**: Each node represents a decision based on a feature value.\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: End nodes represent the final classification (e.g., Setosa or not Setosa).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Non-linear Boundaries**: Can capture complex patterns and interactions between features.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Easy to visualize and understand the decision-making process.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can handle both binary and multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Can create overly complex trees that fit the training data too well but perform poorly on new data.\n",
    "- **Instability**: Small changes in the data can lead to different splits and a different tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Forest\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Multiple Trees**: Builds multiple decision trees using different subsets of the data and features.\n",
    "- **Voting**: Each tree makes a prediction, and the final classification is based on the majority vote from all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Reduced Overfitting**: By averaging multiple trees, random forests reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: More stable and less sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: Generally provides better performance than a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Complexity**: More complex and computationally intensive than a single decision tree.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Harder to interpret compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points of different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Hyperplane**: SVM finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the closest data points of different classes (support vectors).\n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: SVM can use different kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to transform the input data into higher-dimensional spaces, allowing it to handle non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Effective in High Dimensions**: Performs well in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Effective even when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can handle both linear and non-linear classification problems using different kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Complexity**: More complex and computationally intensive than logistic regression.\n",
    "- **Parameter Tuning**: Requires careful tuning of parameters (e.g., kernel type, regularization) for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Bayes' Theorem**: Calculates the probability of each class given the input features.\n",
    "- **Independence Assumption**: Assumes that the features are independent given the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Fast and works well with large datasets.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Performs well even with small amounts of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Independence Assumption**: Assumes features are independent, which is often not true in real-world data.\n",
    "- **Limited Flexibility**: May not capture complex relationships between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "- **Distance Calculation**: Calculates the distance between the input data point and all other points in the training set.\n",
    "- **Voting**: The input data point is classified based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can handle multi-class classification.\n",
    "- **No Training Phase**: No explicit training phase, making it fast to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- **Computationally Intensive**: Can be slow for large datasets due to distance calculations.\n",
    "- **Storage Requirements**: Requires storing the entire training dataset.\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Noise**: Sensitive to irrelevant or noisy features.\n"
