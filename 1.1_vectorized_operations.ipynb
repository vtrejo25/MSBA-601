    "# Vectorized Operations vs. Python Loops\n",
    "**Vectorized operations** avoid slow Python loops by leveraging optimized low-level implementations (in C/Fortran) that operate on entire arrays at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Are Python Loops Slow?\n",
    "Python loops (`for` and `while`) are inherently slow due to:\n",
    "- **Interpreted Execution**: Python is an interpreted language, adding overhead.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing**: Variable types are checked at runtime.\n",
    "- **Function Call Overhead**: Frequent function calls introduce extra processing time.\n",
    "- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Python's GIL restricts parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Vectorized Operations?\n",
    "Vectorized operations use **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** to process multiple data points simultaneously. Libraries like NumPy implement these operations efficiently in compiled C code.\n"
